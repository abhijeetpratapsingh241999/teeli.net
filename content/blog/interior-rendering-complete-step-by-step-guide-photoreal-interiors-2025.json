    "# 🏠 What Is Interior Rendering and Why It Matters",
    "",
    "Interior rendering is the digital process of creating lifelike 3D visuals that show what a finished room will look like before it's built. It allows interior designers, architects, and clients to visualize spaces — from furniture placement to natural light balance — without physically constructing anything. Modern rendering software simulates how real-world lighting interacts with materials like wood, glass, and fabric. This realistic output helps clients make faster decisions, avoid costly design mistakes, and market spaces effectively through digital imagery.",
    "",
    "According to Autodesk's 2024 Visualization Trends, firms using 3D interior rendering reduce revision cycles by 35–40% and increase client approval rates by 30%.",
